**Project Overview**
This project aims to create a dynamic and responsive property listing page. The page is structured using reusable components (Header, Footer, Layout) and incorporates a hero section, filtering options, and a listing area populated with property data. Tailwind CSS is used for styling to ensure responsiveness across various devices.

**Features** 
Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Component-Based Architecture: Uses reusable components (Header, Footer, Layout) for maintainability.
Dynamic Listing: Renders property listings dynamically from a data source.
Filtering: Allows users to filter properties based on specific criteria.
Tailwind CSS Styling: Modern and utility-first CSS framework for rapid development.
TypeScript: Static typing for improved code quality and maintainability.
Next.js Framework: Server-side rendering and other performance benefits.
